 Microsoft's New Movie series will be a block buster!
 

Task: Present to Microsoft on how they can penetrate the movie industry successfully. I analyzed the data and found previous movies financial records. 


# Business Problem

Microsoft is interested in the movie industry. Their lack of experience has led them to source
out a specialist in the field. I will inform Microsoft of the proper steps and strategy while 
using visualization tools, looking at historic data will allow us a clear vision and path. Becoming profitable with a reasonable production budget will be revealed in the data. 
Questions being considered:
What are the top films with the most financial success based on genre?
Runtime with high revenue ?
Understand the film industry through data?


# Data
*******We've chosen to analyze two datasets (tmdb.movies.csv.gz, tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz). After review we cleaned and combined them into one main dataframe clean_df“”. 
Missing data appears to be an issue and will be omitted because it is useless and minimal data points. runtime missing data does not have a overall revenue that falls into the top 20.
The most valuable dataset is “tn.movie_budgets” because it provides budget and gross revenue.  This resource is highly recognized for revenue across many dimensions, combined we have over 30 thousands data points



## Methods
created roi and foreign column to evaluate which movie is having he most success.  
creating dataframes to compensate for the lack of data provided.
Runetime median by top 5 genre revenue.
Analysis of finances for both domestic and foreign to capture which market makes more moeny and where we should invest our marketing budget



## Results
Production budget should mostly be used towars foreign markets 2
run_time above the median for the top 5 genres will make more money.
The Foreign market will be necessary to reach our revenue goal. 



## Conclusions






## Future Investigations
